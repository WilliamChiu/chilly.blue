<pre class="poem">
Two Two Eight Two Four Five.

Young man,
There's an ATM across the street.
Use it - get some cash,
But first,
Do me
A favor and,
Get off the fucking line.

I'll pay in cash.
Thanks for the help, man.
I pay you back.
This guy.
This guy though.
I don't understand.
What's with this guy though.

Are you going?
No no id rather stay
At home.

The fifty something
Year old lady.
From the projects
With the
And the 
And the dog named
And the pregnant
And the ex on
And the love of dogs
And full of affection
For us even though we don't know her
For me even though I stole
Her story because I loved her

Yawns rumble
In the ears rumble
Dance floor rumble
Learn to dance rumble
Skin sweat water rumble
King and a queen rumble
A dozen jacks and their phones
Rumble
Jackshit

I like what you did
With your eyes
But I didn't tell you
And I kind of am
Losing course of where
I'm heading

Trinity tiger
It's natural
We all are trinity Tigers
We all tiger around
Two hundred of us tigers
Tigering tigers tiger other tigers
Tigers tiger other tigers tiger
Tigering many tigers
Expecting tigers to tiger
Tiger tiger tiger tiger tiger tiger tiger?
No tiger.

Did you not get the hint?
The hint?
The fucking
Hint?
Well do I
Have new for
You my dear
Sir friend Madame
Mademoiselle
I like that one there

You are not the type
Right?
I will kill you if you don't
But I won't
Because I
Don't care about you
Enough to have the slightest
Inclination to help you.

Knees weak
Arms are in the air
Got you with my eyes
For the briefest moment
And away we go
And away I go
And away I try to find a way
To escape to another day
Another day down the road
Perhaps even a test day
It's late and time
To sleep

Dragons breath
Bursting out from the side
Alluring
Overwhelming
Spiteful jealous self harming
Two sides of a coin
A coin buried in shit

Dear maxi kaxi
Do you see what's going on
Do you see
How stupid I am
Let the fellow dream
Im no fellow
Who knows what I am
I only know I'm not

Four One Six Nine Five Nine.

Butterflies and lullabies pretending to fly free,
Flying thoughts and flowing dreams,
Foie gras of human flesh,
The best liars are the most honest,
Chewing gum and deodorant,
Lose.
Three free nowhere to be,
Damnation in a notebook?
Breathe in and then,
Breathe out with your nostrils,
Flaring.
I think Sylvia Plath likes vodka.
Find me if you want me to fill in the details.
...Except me and people who still possess a sense of taste.
Lots and lots of shitty...
He takes the easy way out.
Both of us take the easy way out.
Theres no... here.
Only flesh.
And sometimes that is alright.
And sometimes that is alright.
Acid slosh ceramic.
Dripping into whirling down.
I hope I'm not the root...
...Somewhere in the ballpark of six or seven.
Playing life...
I'm glad to be thought of as a friend,
When I'm hundreds of miles below,
Looking upwards at you with awe.
You make it out as if,
I'm just as special as you are.

Five Three Four Three Nine.

And listening to all the people around things get clearer,
Sometimes looking inwards does nothing to fix the problem.
But still, the key to the outside may be locked up inside.
Nothing much to say except that things just keep on going,
