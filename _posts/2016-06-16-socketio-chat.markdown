This is my first time testing out Socket.io and it is pretty amazing! One of the demos involves making a [chat](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/), which happens to be one of the checkpoints on a highschool app I'm still working on... 

Well, here is a slightly fleshed out version of the above demo. It includes identification through random numbers, private messaging, and a few other surprises that I'm sure you could figure out.

The chat itself is currently hosted for free, albeit with credit card identification, through Microsoft Azure. The process was pretty painless and the service seems great thus far.

**Update:** So I ended up switching to OpenShift, which is where the chat is currently hosted. I made this decision because Microsoft Azure's free trial lasts for a year and the pricing calculator is confusing. On the flipside, OpenShift lasts for the foreseeable future and doesn't have my credit card.
